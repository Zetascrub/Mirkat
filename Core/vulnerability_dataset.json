        "Description": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities may arise when applications rely solely on HTTP cookies to identify the user that has issued a particular request. Because browsers automatically add cookies to requests regardless of their origin, it may be possible for an attacker to create a malicious web site that forges a cross-domain request to the vulnerable application. For a request to be vulnerable to CSRF, the following conditions must hold:\n1. The request can be issued cross-domain, for example using a HTML form. If the request contains non-standard headers or body content, then it may only be issuable from a page that originated on the same domain.\n2. The application relies solely on HTTP cookies or Basic Authentication to identify the user that issued the request. If the application places session-related tokens elsewhere within the request, then it may not be vulnerable.\nThe request performs some privileged action within the application, which modifies the application's state based on the identity of the issuing user.\n3. The attacker can determine all the parameters required to construct a request that performs the action. If the request contains any values that the attacker cannot determine or predict, then it is not vulnerable.\n\nImpact:\nThis issue could result in users unknowingly making requests on behalf of an attacker which could result in information disclosure, data modification or Denial-of-Service.",
        "AffectedComponents": "",
        "Recommendation": "The most effective way to protect against CSRF vulnerabilities is to include within relevant requests an additional token that is not transmitted in a cookie: for example, a parameter in a hidden form field. This additional token should contain sufficient entropy, and be generated using a cryptographic random number generator, such that it is not feasible for an attacker to determine or predict the value of any token that was issued to another user. The token should be associated with the user's session, and the application should validate that the correct token is received before performing any action resulting from the request.\nAn alternative approach, which may be easier to implement, is to validate that Host and Referer headers in relevant requests are both present and contain the same domain name. However, this approach is somewhat less robust: historically, quirks in browsers and plugins have often enabled attackers to forge cross-domain requests that manipulate these headers to bypass such defences.",

        "Description": "The application fails to prevent users from connecting to it over unencrypted connections. An attacker able to modify a legitimate user's network traffic could bypass the application's use of SSL/TLS encryption, and use the application as a platform for attacks against its users. This attack is performed by rewriting HTTPS links as HTTP, so that if a targeted user follows a link to the site from a HTTP page, their browser never attempts to use an encrypted connection. The sslstrip tool automates this process.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be suitably positioned to intercept and modify the victim's network traffic.This scenario typically occurs when a client communicates with the server over an insecure connection such as public Wi-Fi, or a corporate or home network that is shared with a compromised computer. Common defences such as switched networks are not sufficient to prevent this. An attacker situated in the user's ISP or the application's hosting infrastructure could also perform this attack. Note that an advanced adversary could potentially target any connection made over the Internet's core infrastructure.\n\nImpact:\nAn attacker could use this issue to force users to navigate over the clear-text protocol HTTP. This would then make the users network traffic susceptible to interception and as a result could disclose sensitive information. ",

To do this, enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) by adding a response header with the name 'Strict-Transport-Security' and the value 'max-age=expireTime', where expireTime is the time in seconds that browsers should remember that the site should only be accessed using HTTPS. Consider adding the 'includeSubDomains' flag if appropriate.\nNote that because HSTS is a \"trust on first use\" (TOFU) protocol, a user who has never accessed the application will never have seen the HSTS header, and will therefore still be vulnerable to SSL stripping attacks. To mitigate this risk, you can optionally add the 'preload' flag to the HSTS header, and submit the domain for review by browser vendors.",

NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. \n\nMulticast DNS (mDNS) is a protocol which was developed by Apple, as a method to perform local network name and service discovery without the need for central name resolution, such as a DNS Server, and without user interaction.\n\nThe consultant (and an attacker) was able to spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on the network by responding to LLMNR (UDP 5355)/NBT-NS (UDP 137)/mDNS (UDP 5353) traffic as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the consultant's system. If the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication, the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the consultant's system. The consultant was then able to collect the hash information sent over the wire and to attempt to crack the hashes offline through Brute Force to obtain the plaintext passwords.\n\nOver 4500 password hashes were captured in the assessment however none of these were able to be cracked during the time frame.

The Enterprise CA's configuration must permit low-privileged users the ability to request certificates. See the \"Background - Enrolment\" section at the beginning of the whitepaper paper for more details.\n-Manager approval is disabled. This setting necessitates that a user with certificate \"manager\" permissions review and approve the requested certificate before the certificate is issued. See the \"Background - Issuance Requirements\" section at the beginning of the whitepaper paper for more details.\n-No authorized signatures are required. This setting requires any CSR to be signed by an existing authorized certificate. See the \"Background - Issuance Requirements\" section at the beginning of the whitepaper for more details.\n-An overly permissive certificate template security descriptor grants certificate enrolment rights to low-privileged users. Having certificate enrolment rights allows a low-privileged attacker to request and obtain a certificate based on the template. Enrolment Rights are granted via the certificate template AD object's security descriptor.\n-The certificate template defines EKUs that enable authentication. Applicable EKUs include Client Authentication (OID 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2), PKINIT Client Authentication (OID 1.3.6.1.5.2.3.4), or Smart Card Logon (OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.2).\n-The certificate template allows requesters to specify a subjectAltName (SAN) in the CSR. If a requester can specify the SAN in a CSR, the requester can request a certificate as anyone (e.g., a domain admin user). The certificate template's AD object specifies if the requester can specify the SAN in its mspki-certificate-name-flag property. The mspki-certificate-name-flag property is a bitmask and if the CT_FLAG_ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT flag is present, a requester can specify the SAN.\n\nThis situation means that a unprivileged users can request a certificate that can be used for domain authentication, where they can specify an arbitrary alternative name (like a domain admin).

Unless alternate names are really needed for this template, this is probably the best fix.\n-Remove the \"Client Authentication\" and/or \"Smart Card Logon\" EKUS via \"Extensions\" -> \"Application Policies\". This prevents domain authentication with this template.\n-Enable \"CA Certificate Manager Approval\" in \"Issuance Requirements\". This puts requests for this template in the \"Pending Requests\" queue that must be manually approved by a certificate manager.\n-Enable Authorized Signatures\" in \"Issuance Requirements\" (if you know what you're doing).

PowerShell version 2 is quite outdated, and it was first released with Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. It lacks several important features and enhancements available in later versions of PowerShell and it is recommended to remove or disable it if possible. \n\nIt lacks the security features and enhancements implemented in later versions, such as Constrained Language Mode, Just Enough Administration (JEA), and script block logging. Upgrading to a newer version will provide better security for your scripts and automation tasks. In addition PowerShell version 2 does not include support for the Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI). AMSI is a security feature introduced in later versions of PowerShell (version 3 and higher) to provide enhanced malware protection by allowing antivirus and other security products to scan PowerShell content for potential threats.\n\nImpact:\nPowerShell version 2 is commonly abused by threat actors and ransomware groups as it provides an attacker with a very easier method of bypassing security controls such as AMSI and CLM and ultimately loading malicious code.",

        "Description": "Since September 2016, Microsoft has strongly encouraged that SMBv1 be disabled and no longer used on modern networks, as it is a 30 year old design that is much more vulnerable to attacks then much newer designs such as SMBv2 and SMBv3.\n\nSMB version 1 was not identified on the remote service. Version 2 and above was found to be in use.\n\nImpact:\n\nSome legacy OSes (e.g. Windows XP, Server 2003 or older), applications and appliances may no longer be able to communicate with the system once SMBv1 is disabled. We recommend careful testing be performed to determine the impact prior to configuring this as a widespread control, and where possible, remediate any incompatibilities found with the vendor of the incompatible system.

DNS on Mac OS X is integrated with Bonjour and should not be turned off, but the Bonjour advertising service can be disabled.\n\nBonjour can simplify device discovery from an internal rogue or compromised host. An attacker could use Bonjour's multicast DNS feature to discover a vulnerable or poorly - configured service or additional information to aid a targeted attack. Implementing this control disables the continuous broadcasting of \"I'm here!\" messages. Typical end-user endpoints should not have to advertise services to other computers.

If an administrator in the VM logs in using a VMware remote console during their session, a non-administrator in the VM can  connect to the console and observe the administrator's actions.  Also, this could result in an administrator losing console access to a virtual machine. For example if a jump box is being used for an open console session, and the admin loses connection to that box, then the console session remains open.  Allowing two console sessions permits debugging via a shared session.  For highest security, only one remote console session at a time should be allowed. \n\nThe affected virtual machines (VMs) permitted the use of multiple simultaneous console connections. In some scenarios, this potentially could allow for information disclosure and console session hijacking to occur. When connected to the host, it was possible to open two console connections to the same Virtual Machine, at the same time.  One on a new tab and another in a separate console window.\n\nBy default, remote console sessions can exist simultaneously, with vSphere users of different permission level (but being granted remote console access) having the same access to the session. A user with limited or no access to the VM operating system could \"ride\" an authenticated session belonging to a user who did have permissions on the VM operating system, thereby effectively gaining unauthorised access to the VM. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that console sessions remain active if a console connection is dropped or disconnected. \n\nIn all affected cases, the relevant parameter (RemoteDisplay.maxConnections) had not been defined and therefore the number of remote connections had not been restricted. \n\nAffected VMs:\n\n\n",

If an administrator in the VM logs in using a VMware remote console during their session, a non-administrator in the VM can  connect to the console and observe the administrator's actions.  Also, this could result in an administrator losing console access to a virtual machine. For example if a jump box is being used for an open console session, and the admin loses connection to that box, then the console session remains open.  Allowing two console sessions permits debugging via a shared session.  For highest security, only one remote console session at a time should be allowed. \n\nThe affected virtual machines (VMs) permitted the use of multiple simultaneous console connections. In some scenarios, this potentially could allow for information disclosure and console session hijacking to occur. When connected to the host, it was possible to open two console connections to the same Virtual Machine, at the same time.  One on a new tab and another in a separate console window.\n\nBy default, remote console sessions can exist simultaneously, with vSphere users of different permission level (but being granted remote console access) having the same access to the session. A user with limited or no access to the VM operating system could \"ride\" an authenticated session belonging to a user who did have permissions on the VM operating system, thereby effectively gaining unauthorised access to the VM. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that console sessions remain active if a console connection is dropped or disconnected. \n\nIn all affected cases, the relevant parameter (RemoteDisplay.maxConnections) had not been defined and therefore the number of remote connections had not been restricted. \n\nAffected VMs:\n\n\n",

        "Description": "Injection vulnerabilities arise when user-controllable data is incorporated into database SQL queries in an unsafe manner. An attacker can supply crafted input to break out of the data context in which their input appears and interfere with the structure of the surrounding query.\n\nA wide range of damaging attacks can often be delivered via injection attacks, including reading or modifying critical application data, interfering with application logic, escalating privileges within the database and taking control of the database server. \n\nA number of fields within the assessed applications are known to send user supplied data into database queries.  The following points have been identified as injectable with a number of others considered as potentially injectable.  Despite a number of tests, the consultant was unable to trigger a larger than expected query against the database, and all requests that could risk data availability/integrity were out of scope.  \n\nConfirmed Application Injection Points\nXXXXXXX - Application Number Field\n",
        "AffectedComponents": "",
        "Recommendation": "General Recommendations:\nReview the code of all applications to ensure use of user supplied content is minimised, and if/where required, it is parametrised, sanitised and escaped as appropriate.  \n\nThe most effective way to prevent SQL injection attacks is to use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) for all database access. This method uses two steps to incorporate potentially tainted data into SQL queries: first, the application specifies the structure of the query, leaving placeholders for each item of user input; second, the application specifies the contents of each placeholder. Because the structure of the query has already been defined in the first step, it is not possible for malformed data in the second step to interfere with the query structure. You should review the documentation for your database and application platform to determine the appropriate APIs which you can use to perform parameterized queries. It is strongly recommended that you parameterize ever variable data item that is incorporated into database queries, even if it is not obviously tainted, to prevent oversights occurring and avoid vulnerabilities being introduced by changes elsewhere within the code base of the application.\n\nYou should be aware that some commonly employed and recommended mitigations for SQL injection vulnerabilities are not always effective: \n\nOne common defence is to double up any single quotation marks appearing within user input before incorporating that input into a SQL query. This defence is designed to prevent malformed data from terminating the string into which it is inserted. However, if the data being incorporated into queries is numeric, then the defence may fail, because numeric data may not be encapsulated within quotes, in which case only a space is required to break out of the data context and interfere with the query. Further, in second-order SQL injection attacks, data that has been safely escaped when initially inserted into the database is subsequently read from the database and then passed back to it again. Quotation marks that have been doubled up initially will return to their original form when the data is reused, allowing the defence to be bypassed.\n\nAnother often cited defence is to use stored procedures for database access. While stored procedures can provide security benefits, they are not guaranteed to prevent SQL injection attacks. The same kinds of vulnerabilities that arise within standard dynamic SQL queries can arise if any SQL is dynamically constructed within stored procedures. Further, even if the procedure is sound, SQL injection can arise if the procedure is invoked in an unsafe manner using user-controllable data.",

        "Description": "This section reviews security configurations relating to the mobile device policy.  \n\nPasswordEnabled is set to False, recommendation is True. \nPasswords should be necessary to unlock mobile devices because they will help secure sensitive information stored on the devices in the event of loss or theft. Allowing users to access devices without passwords means that anyone with physical access to them can view data on the devices. Users will have to re-enter their password each time they want to use their device.\n\nAllowSimplePassword is set to True, recommendation is False.\nYou can configure this setting to require strong passwords to unlock mobile devices before they can connect via ActiveSync to an Exchange server. Allowing simple passwords can make it easier for an attacker to correctly guess them. Note: Users will be forced to use strong passwords.\n\nAlphanumericPasswordRequired is set to False, recommendation is True. \nRequiring users to include non-numeric characters in their passwords increases the strength of password security in your organization. Not requiring alphanumeric passwords can make it easier for an attacker to correctly guess them.\n\nPasswordHistory is set to 0, recomendation is 4.  \nThe longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can determine the password through a brute force attack. Also, any accounts that may have been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly reduced. If you specify a low number for this setting, users will be able to use the same small number of passwords repeatedly.\n\nPasswordExpiration is set to Unlimited, recommendation is currently 90 or less.  However recent NCSC guidance suggests this can be further extended providing appropriate training is in place to support password change as part of incident response.  \nThe longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a brute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the user sharing the password. Configuring this setting to 0 so that users are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because doing so allows a compromised password to be used by a malicious user for as long as the valid user has authorized access to the system.\n\nMinPasswordLength is currently set to 4, recommendation is 4 or greater.  Consider increasing the minimum length.  \nYou can configure this setting to specify a minimum password length for device passwords. Long passwords can provide increased security. However, long passwords can decrease device usability.\nTypes of password attacks include dictionary attacks that use common words and phrases, and brute force attacks that use character combinations. Attackers also sometimes try to obtain an account database so they can use tools to discover accounts and passwords.\n\nMaxPasswordFailedAttempts is set to 8, the default is 6 and the recommended is 10 or less.  Good. \nUse this setting to restrict the number of failed logon attempts a user can make. There is a high risk that mobile devices will be lost or stolen. Enforcing this setting reduces the likelihood that an unauthorized user can guess the password of a device to access data stored on it.\n\nDevicePolicyRefreshInterval is set to Unlimited, recommendation is 1:00:00.  \nYou can configure this setting to specify how often in hours that policy settings should be refreshed. Refreshing the policy settings sends a fresh copy of the policy down to devices. Organizational requirements change, and new vulnerabilities may be discovered, so it is likely that ActiveSync policy settings will change. For these reasons, it is important to configure a refresh interval to ensure that the latest policy settings are applied to the devices in your organization.\n\nAllowNonProvisionableDevices is set to True.  Default and the recommended setting is False.  Consider reviewing this setting.  \nThis setting determines whether Exchange allow devices that do not accept security policy updates from the Exchange server to use ActiveSync. Unmanaged devices are more likely to not comply with an organization's security policies and to be infected by malicious software. To implement the recommended state, execute the following PowerShell cmdlet: \"Set-MobileDeviceMailboxPolicy -Identity default -AllowNonProvisionableDevices $false\".  Users who configure their devices to block security policy or have devices that cannot receive security policy will be unable to use ActiveSync to connect to the server.\n\nRequireDeviceEncryption is set to False, recommended setting is true.  \nYou can use this setting to require device encryption. Configuring this setting to require device encryption increases security by encrypting all information on the storage cards for the device. Unencrypted data on mobile devices is vulnerable to attack. Requiring ActiveSync encryption helps to minimize the risk of information being compromised in case a mobile device is lost.\n\nMaxInactivityTimeLock is set to 00:15:00. The recommended value is 15.  Good.\nYou can configure this setting to prompt the user for a password after the user's device has been inactive for a specified period of time. For example, if you configure the time period for this setting to 15 minutes, the user must enter the device password every time it has been idle for 15 minutes. If the device has been idle less than 15 minutes, the user is not required to re-enter the password. Mobile devices are often left unattended or lost in public places. Requiring devices to lock after 15 minutes minimizes the window of opportunity for an attacker to tamper with a lost or stolen device.\n\n",

For internal message flow, Exchange Server uses the custom X-MS-Exchange-Organization-OriginalSize message header to record the original message size of the message as it enters the Exchange Server organization. Whenever the message is checked against the specified message size limits, either the lower value of the current message size or the original message size header is used. The size of the message can change because of content conversion, encoding, and agent processing. This setting somewhat limits the impact that a malicious user or a computer with malware can have on the Exchange infrastructure by restricting the size of incoming messages.\n\nMaxSendSize is set to 20 MB (20,971,520 bytes), the recommended size is 10240KB. \nMaxSendSize has been increases from the recommended default of 10MB to 20MB.  INFORMATIONAL.  \nThis limit includes the message header, the message body, and any attachments. For internal message flow, Exchange Server uses the custom X-MS-Exchange-Organization-OriginalSize message header to record the original message size of the message as it enters the Exchange Server organization.

This setting somewhat limits the impact that a malicious user or a computer with malware can have on the Exchange infrastructure by restricting the size of outgoing messages.\n\nPickupDirectoryMaxRecipientsPerMessage: 100\nYou can use this setting to control the total number of message recipients. When a message is first composed, the recipients exist in the To:, Cc:, and Bcc: header fields. When the message is submitted for delivery, the message recipients are converted into RCPT TO: entries in the message envelope. A distribution group is counted as a single recipient during message submission.\n\nMessageTrackingLogEnabled was set to True.  Good. \nA message tracking log provides a detailed log of all message activity as messages are transferred to and from a computer running Exchange. Message tracking is available on Hub Transport servers, Edge Transport servers, and Mailbox servers. By default, message tracking is enabled.\n\nConnectivityLogEnabled was set to True.  Good. \nA connectivity log is a record of the SMTP connection activity of the outbound message delivery queues to the destination Mailbox server, smart host, or domain. Connectivity logging is available on Hub Transport servers and Edge Transport servers. By default, connectivity logging is disabled.\n\nPopSettings LoginType was set to SecureLogin.  Good. \nPOP3 transmits all data, including user credentials and potentially sensitive messages, in plaintext. Using this setting to enable TLS ensures that POP3 network traffic is encrypted, and it allows the client to verify the server's address.\n\nImapSettings LoginType was set to SecureLogin.  Good. \nIMAP4 transmits all data, including user credentials and potentially sensitive messages, in plaintext. Using this setting to enable SSL ensures that IMAP4 network traffic is encrypted, and it allows the client to verify the server's address.\n\n",

For example, how a content delivery network protects your private key, or how a cloud payment provider detects fraudulent transactions, are important security considerations over and above the general considerations covered by the cloud security principles. \n\nWith IaaS and PaaS offerings, you are responsible for significant aspects of the security of your data and workloads.

Some useful policy settings to consider would be :\n\nImpersonation Protection:\nSpecific high value user accounts such as CEO's, Heads of Finance are often targets of mail spoofing attacks in which attackers send mails attempting to impersonate these users in order to carry out attacks. With the impersonation protection either entire domains or specific users can be added to allow specific actions to be taken on mail attempting to spoof these senders. These mails can be silently deleted, quarantined or forwarded to a secure mailbox for further analysis and threat hunting actions. The tools can use various means of discerning real mail from spoofed mail such as Intelligence based mailbox learning or the removal of mail using suspicious characters. \n\nAnti-Phishing Thresholds:\nAs with a lot of spam controls the threshold or aggressiveness of actions taken can be adjusted. This can be useful if the organisation finds itself under attack from a particular method it might be prudent to increase the threshold during this attack to reduce the likelihood of compromise at the expense of a potential up tick in false positive actions. \n\nUnauthenticated Sender Identification:\nThis setting can aid in the identification and prevention of suspicious mail. It will provide a number of visual prompts such as \"?\" next to the sender Icon and provide the user with information such as: \"This mail was sent by X@organisation.com via Y@suspicious.com\". These prompts can help reduce the effectiveness of phishing campaigns.\n\nThe vast majority of spam or phishing policies will require testing within the domain, as depending on the use cases for the mail system certain recommendations may restrict use of the service too much. However these settings are very important and should be considered where possible. ",

Access Analyzer is an Identity and Access Management (IAM) feature that helps you find potential security risks in your AWS cloud environment by analysing the resource-based policies associated with the cloud resources within your zone of trust. The access initiated by the principals created within your zone of trust (i.e. your account or organization) is considered trusted. When IAM Access Analyzer identifies a resource-based policy that allows access to your resources from outside of your zone of trust, it generates a finding. You can use the information generated by the finding, such as the resource name and type, access level and the external principal that has access to the resource, to determine whether the access is intended or unintended. If the access is unintended, it represents a security risk, and therefore actions must be taken to mitigate the risk (e.g. remove the unwanted access).\n\n\n",

        "Recommendation": "Amazon IAM Access Analyzer helps you evaluate access permissions across your entire AWS cloud environment so that your security teams and administrators can quickly validate the resource-based policies that provide intended access to your resources and redefine the policies that allow unintended access by following the Principle of Least Privilege (i.e. the practice of providing the minimal amount of access required to perform the desired task). Once enabled, Amazon IAM Access Analyzer starts monitoring the access policies associated with S3 buckets, KMS CMKs, SQS queues, IAM roles, and Lambda functions for permissions changes so that you no longer need to rely on intermittent manual checks to catch access security issues when these type of policies are added or updated. The benefits of using IAM Access Analyzer include saving time required to analyse resource-based policies for public or cross-account accessibility, providing guidance to refine access permissions, continuous monitoring, and providing the highest levels of security assurance.",

        "Description": "Each VPC network has its own distributed firewall, which allows or denies traffic into and out of the network, and between VM instances. The firewall has an explicit-deny policy, meaning that any traffic that needs to be permitted must have a rule created.  You cannot create \u201cdeny\u201d rules, only \u201callow\u201d rules.\n\nThe firewall rules for the VPC within which the VPNs exist were as follows:\n\nName: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nType: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX    \nTargets: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX          \nFilters: IP ranges: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX                                  \nProtocols/ports: tcp:443 \nAction: Allow\nPriority: 1000 \nNetwork: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nThis prevents all traffic apart from 443 HTTPs to specific host ranges. This looks to be well configured.  If additional traffic must be allowed, continue to follow the principles of being as specific as possible to limit the traffic to only the necessary services and devices.\n\nFor the VPN itself, to ensure that ACLs remain relevant and correct, the peer VPN gateway must have a static external (internet routable) IPv4 address to ensure it does not change unexpectedly. \n\nIf the remote peer VPN gateway is behind a firewall rule, you must configure the firewall rule to pass ESP (IPsec) protocol and IKE (UDP 500 and UDP 4500) traffic to it. If the firewall rule provides network address translation (NAT), UDP encapsulation and NAT-T see: https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/vpn/concepts/advanced.\n\n",

        "Recommendation": "Configure the firewall rules to allow only the necessary ports/services to the necessary devices. Overly permissive access (e.g all ports or any IP address) should be avoided to prevent unintended access and malicious abuse.",

Split tunnelling is where some traffic is routed directly from the client to external target systems, whilst other traffic is routed through the tunnel. Split tunnelling is achieved when administrators define routes to IP networks that are reachable over the VPN connection, and routes to IP networks which are not. It is commonly used for quality/bandwidth sensitive traffic that is known to be otherwise protected, such as that used within Realtime communications. \n\nThe design indicates that \"Managed Split Tunnel\" is the intended configuration, however full details of the client system routing were not available for review. A PAC file is proposed for use by the client browser, which infers that the client routing table may favour direct internet connection, making split tunnel routing decisions based on the proxy configuration rather than the systems routing table. \n\nImpact:\nPAC file routing can leave the client more exposed, as any traffic from the client that does not honour the PAC file configuration will route directly to the internet (this could, for example, include malware payloads).
